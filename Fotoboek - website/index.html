            I know Cinemaximilian through a friend majdi , it brings me a <br />
            lot about new connections and friends and also the <br />
            atmosphere in cmx is very kind ( like a family ) and the vibes <br />
            together as one is what I like the most. And it brings me fun <br />
            and happiness with the CInemaximiliaan family.

                    Because of caring for my daughter, I could <br>
                    not leave Brussels this summer. Then I <br>
                    decided to commit to Cinema Trottoir, a 5 <br>
                    weekend film festival organized by <br>
                    Cinemaximilian asbl. I decided to join the <br>
                    cooking team, led by Ashour. Together we <br>
                    conjured up buffets brimming with goodies <br>
                    from Gaza. Which led to great enjoyment <br>
                    and much conviviality among the <br>
                    numerous visitors. <br> <br>
                    “I did not miss traveling because CMX is <br>
                    one of those places where the world <br>
                    comes to us“. - Barara <br> <br>
                    In this way, I was able to experience CMX as <br>
                    a solidary, open place where connections <br>
                    develop between people regardless of their <br>
                    native soil, age, religion, orientation, <br>
                    interests, ... For me personally, it became a <br>
                    necessary place of “focus in the now,” of <br>
                    rolling up your sleeves and being able to be <br>
                    concrete. A breath of fresh air. A warm <br>
                    embrace. A gift in mutual solidarity. Now I <br>
                    look forward to my first winter visits to <br>
                    asylum centers.
