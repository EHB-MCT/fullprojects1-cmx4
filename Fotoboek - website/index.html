						Because of caring for my daughter, I could <br />
						not leave Brussels this summer. Then I <br />
						decided to commit to Cinema Trottoir, a 5 <br />
						weekend film festival organized by <br />
						Cinemaximilian asbl. I decided to join the <br />
						cooking team, led by Ashour. Together we <br />
						conjured up buffets brimming with goodies <br />
						from Gaza. Which led to great enjoyment <br />
						and much conviviality among the <br />
						numerous visitors. <br />

							one of those places where the world <br />
							comes to us“. - Barara </strong
						><br />
						<br />
						In this way, I was able to experience CMX as <br />
						a solidary, open place where connections <br />
						develop between people regardless of their <br />
						native soil, age, religion, orientation, <br />
						interests, ... For me personally, it became a <br />
						necessary place of “focus in the now,” of <br />
						rolling up your sleeves and being able to be <br />
						concrete. A breath of fresh air. A warm <br />
						embrace. A gift in mutual solidarity. Now I <br />
						look forward to my first winter visits to <br />
						asylum centers.

						In August, I joined an open lunch at <br />
						Cinemaximiliaan (CMX) through a friend <br />
						and immediately felt at home in its warm, <br />
						collective atmosphere. <br /><br />
						<strong
							>“I became an active volunteer, helping <br />
							with the Cinema Trottoir Festival and <br />
							Friday cooking sessions, and soon saw <br />
							CMX as a "family" ”. - Viet </strong
						><br /><br />
						As a filmmaker and immigrant seeking to <br />
						connect with Belgian society, CMX provided <br />
						a sense of community I had long been <br />
						searching for. <br />
						Currently, CMX supports me as the <br />
						production entity for my next <br />
						medium-length documentary, funded by <br />
						the 2021 Wildcards Award from the Flemish <br />
						Audio-visual Fonds (VAF). This collaboration <br />
						highlights CMX's dedication to <br />
						independent, human-focused <br />
						documentary cinema, unlike profit-driven <br />
						production companies. Alongside pursuing <br />
						a PhD in the arts, I'm committed to <br />
						nurturing this vital space for artists and <br />
						immigrants.
