							Because of caring for my daughter, I could not leave Brussels this
							summer. Then I decided to commit to Cinema Trottoir, a 5 weekend
							film festival organized by Cinemaximilian asbl. I decided to join
							the cooking team, led by Ashour. Together we conjured up buffets
							brimming with goodies from Gaza. Which led to great enjoyment and
							much conviviality among the numerous visitors.

							><br />
							In this way, I was able to experience CMX as a solidary, open
							place where connections develop between people regardless of their
							native soil, age, religion, orientation, interests, ... For me
							personally, it became a necessary place of “focus in the now,” of
							rolling up your sleeves and being able to be concrete. A breath of
							fresh air. A warm embrace. A gift in mutual solidarity. Now I look
							forward to my first winter visits to asylum centers.

							In August, I joined an open lunch at Cinemaximiliaan (CMX) through
							a friend and immediately felt at home in its warm, collective
							atmosphere. <br />

								Festival and Friday cooking sessions, and soon saw CMX as a

							As a filmmaker and immigrant seeking to connect with Belgian
							society, CMX provided a sense of community I had long been
							searching for. Currently, CMX supports me as the production entity
							for my next medium-length documentary, funded by the 2021
							Wildcards Award from the Flemish Audio-visual Fonds (VAF). This
							collaboration highlights CMX's dedication to independent,
							human-focused documentary cinema, unlike profit-driven production
							companies. Alongside pursuing a PhD in the arts, I'm committed to
							nurturing this vital space for artists and immigrants.

					<p>
						In the past four years, Cinemaximiliaan has transformed my life. We
						organized three Cinema Trottoir festivals, and I rediscovered my
						passion as a film critic and discussion leader. Their network opened
						doors to moderate and critique films, including an invitation from
						Cinematek Brussels. Beyond cinema, their programs enriched me
						personally and artistically. Cinemaximiliaan is more than a
						platform—it’s a family, a sanctuary of creativity and support.
