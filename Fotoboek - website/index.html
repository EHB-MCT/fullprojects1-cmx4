								Because of caring for my daughter, I could not leave Brussels
								this summer. Then I decided to commit to Cinema Trottoir, a 5
								weekend film festival organized by Cinemaximilian asbl. I
								decided to join the cooking team, led by Ashour. Together we
								conjured up buffets brimming with goodies from Gaza. Which led
								to great enjoyment and much conviviality among the numerous
								visitors.<br /><br />

									>“I did not miss traveling because CMX is one of those places
									where the world comes to us“. - Barara
								</strong>
								<br /><br />
								In this way, I was able to experience CMX as a solidary, open
								place where connections develop between people regardless of
								their native soil, age, religion, orientation, interests, ...
								For me personally, it became a necessary place of “focus in the
								now,” of rolling up your sleeves and being able to be concrete.
								A breath of fresh air. A warm embrace. A gift in mutual
								solidarity. Now I look forward to my first winter visits to
								asylum centers.

								In August, I joined an open lunch at Cinemaximiliaan (CMX)
								through a friend and immediately felt at home in its warm,
								collective atmosphere. <br /><br />

									Trottoir Festival and Friday cooking sessions, and soon saw
									CMX as a "family" ”. - Viet </strong
								><br /><br />
								As a filmmaker and immigrant seeking to connect with Belgian
								society, CMX provided a sense of community I had long been
								searching for. Currently, CMX supports me as the production
								entity for my next medium-length documentary, funded by the 2021
								Wildcards Award from the Flemish Audio-visual Fonds (VAF). This
								collaboration highlights CMX's dedication to independent,
								human-focused documentary cinema, unlike profit-driven
								production companies. Alongside pursuing a PhD in the arts, I'm
								committed to nurturing this vital space for artists and
								immigrants.

				<h1>Rola</h1>
				<p>
					In the past four years, Cinemaximiliaan has transformed my life. We
					organized three Cinema Trottoir festivals, and I rediscovered my
					passion as a film critic and discussion leader. Their network opened
					doors to moderate and critique films, including an invitation from
					Cinematek Brussels.
				</p>
				<p>
					Beyond cinema, their programs enriched me personally and artistically.
					Cinemaximiliaan is more than a platform. It’s a family, a sanctuary of
					creativity and support.
